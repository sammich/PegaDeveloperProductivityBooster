# Pega Studio Pro

This is the current home of the *Studio Pro* component.

For issues, questions, feedback, feature requests, suggestions, create an issue. Vote on whatever you think should be added.

## What is it?

Itâ€™s a large (maybe 100+) collection of Developer Experience/Quality of Life modifications to Dev Studio. It was built and used on a real client project.

For super-detailed overview of basically every change, see [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNWQE6xU=/?share_link_id=474308154811).

## Why did you make this component?

I spend a lot of time in Dev Studio and I like the tools I use a lot to be efficient and be friendly to use. Since we want the output of the applications we build on the platform to be 'user friendly' why not our development tools (typically referred to as DX or Developer QoL)?

Therefore, this component was built to:

- reduce the number of clicks to achieve common actions, such as lifting actions out of menus
- surface data that is otherwise hidden, such as the 'pass parameter page'
- increase the density or make better use of the UI
  - the new persistent sidebar
  - the branch landing page
- improve tools such as tracer/clipboard
- remove unnecessary friction, such as with the default password feature

## Requirements

- Pega 8.6 or later
  - See [the Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNWQE6xU=/?moveToWidget=3458764567999200990&cot=14) for full platform compatability notes
- [Pega Peer Review v8.6.8](https://community.pega.com/marketplace/components/peer-review-component) installed

## Installation

The component is currently shipping as a single RAP supporting Pega Inifnity 8.6 to '23.

2. Get a copy of the component (TBA, still in closed testing)
3. Install it like any Pega component.

   Ignore the warning about the component being exported from a newer platform version.
   
5. (Optional) If you're not on the latest Pega version ('23), open the component and change the ruleset version.

   For example, if you're on 8.8.3, change the ruleset version (component is unlocked) from `SamsMods-ProductivityBooster:08-23-01` to `SamsMods-ProductivityBooster:08-08-03`.

6. Save
7. In your application definition, add this component and save.

   There's no need to also have Pega Peer Review component on your component as it's included as a dependency in the component.
   
8. See configuration

## Configuration

The main component configuration uses the platform's [configuration sets in App Studio](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNWQE6xU=/?moveToWidget=3458764568004912838&cot=14). Each configuration is described there.

There are also configurations available on the [Operator-level](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNWQE6xU=/?moveToWidget=3458764568005141127&cot=14).

Please note:

- Configuration sets have a per-application scope. If you don't use the defaults, you will need to set them up for each app you have.
- Defaults *may* change in a componnent release. Check the release notes

## What if something goes wrong? (a.k.a. warranty & support)

No warranty is provided for this component. Support is provided via the GitHub issues on this repo. This is subject to change, as the component is still in closed testing.

1. If it's a blocking issue, remove the component from your app
2. Check the issues page if it's an existing issue, and vote for it, or create a new issue and share as much as you can

## Potential FAQs

- **What environments can I use this in?**

  Technically, there's no reason you can't use this in environments other than dev, but due to the nature of this component
  and that higher environments more production-like (not less), you probably shouldn't. Then again, there's nothing stoppping
  you (except the client).

- **How will other platform versions be supported?**

  When this component adds support for the new platform version (as I did when I validated it for Infinity '23), the following steps are taken:

  - Each overriden rule is checked to see if it has a new version in that release. For example the rule `Rule-Obj-Class pzDataTypeActions` this component copied from is from 8.5. When validating Infinity '23 support, that rule was updated
  - If a rule is updated, a copy is made from the OOTB version and the modifications applied manually

  Every overriden rule has notes on what was changed from the OOTB rule. These notes are visisble for the modified rules.

  New features will follow the same cycle. A feature will be developed on 8.6 (the lowest version supported), and verified/rebuilt for higher versions. I have VMs for every major version, and some minor versions, too.

- **I don't like change X**

  Some features can be turned off. If the option isn't there yet, create an issue and the discussion can happen in there.

- **Do I need to have Pega Peer Review?**

  Yes. Question is, why *aren't* you using it?

- **Can I get a simplified version for use in Prod?**

  If there is enough community support for such a release, with a good reason for which changes make it unsuitable for Pre-Prod/Prod, then it can be considered.

- **How did you modify Dev Studio? Aren't all the rules Final/Internal/pz?**

  Yes.
