# Contributing guidelines

You can contribute to this project by reporting bugs, or suggesting or voting on features.

## Bug reports

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Please provide details in that you yourself would like to recieve.

- **Do not open a duplicate issue!** Search through existing issues to see if your issue has previously been reported. If your issue exists, comment with any additional information you have. You may simply note "I have this problem too", which helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

- **Prefer using [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)**, not comments, if you simply want to "+1" an existing issue.

- **Fully complete the provided issue template.** The bug report template requests all the information we need to quickly and efficiently address your issue. Be clear, concise, and descriptive. Provide as much information as you can.

- **Use [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).** Especially put code blocks and console outputs in backticks (```). This improves readability.

## Feature suggestions

Feature requests are welcome! While we will consider all requests, we cannot guarantee your request will be accepted.

- **Do not open a duplicate feature request.** Search for existing feature requests first. If you find your feature (or one very similar) previously requested, comment on that issue.
    - If the issue exists on the ['Ideas' wiki page](https://github.com/sammich/PegaStudioPro/wiki/Ideas-scratchpad) you are welcome to create a feature request for it (if it doesn't already exist, of course) so we can see it's wanted. Indicate it's from the wiki page and optionally fill out the template, but provide some of your own reasoning.

- **Fully complete the provided template.** The feature request template asks for all necessary information for us to begin a productive conversation. 

- Be precise about the proposed outcome of the feature and how it relates to existing features. If you are able, include implementation potential implementation details, such as which rules and classes will be overridden or impacted.

## Code contributions

Since this is a Pega component, this repo is just for distribution of the component and issue management.

As of writing, we are not accepting RAPs/Branch exports for security reasons.

- If there is a feature you want to see implemented, or raised to our attention from the [Ideas page](https://github.com/sammich/PegaStudioPro/wiki/Ideas-scratchpad), create a feature request issue.

- If you want to take shot at implementing it, without being an official contributor, see the [development guidelines](https://github.com/sammich/PegaStudioPro/wiki/Development-guidelines), and make the changes in your system, and provide documentation of your changes in a new ticket (template TBD). **Please note** that there are *no* guarantees your submission will be propertly reviewed.
