# Known issues

- When updating the ruleset for a rule in a branch, the ruleset isn't shown until a later refresh
- When updating the ruleset for a rule in a branch, after saving, the system shows a conflict guardrail warning for itself
- Copying a share link to a snapshot/deleted rule doesn't work (needs logic to handle the different deleted rule key syntax)
